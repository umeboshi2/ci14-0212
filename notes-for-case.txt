standing of plaintiffs
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The plaintiffs in this action cannot represent the majority interest of the city without meeting
quorum requirements in their standing.  A person may stand in legislative capacity
before a court seeking relief for protecting a privilege incidental to their office,
or a power that can be exercised individually, without the quorum requirements, but
the action currently before the court requires a quorum to exercise the
legislative interest being claimed.  In order to exercise the legislative interest the
plaintiffs have an interest in, there must be a quorum present in a public meeting.  In
the City of Hattiesburg, composed of five wards (complaint of plaintiff 8), there
must be at least three members, this being the smallest simple majority,
present to hold a meeting and take legislative action.  It is not possible for
the plaintiffs to have standing to seek a performance of duty from the
executive branch of the municipality that is required to
be performed before the plaintiffs can subsequently  exercise their legislative power,
since the exercise of that particular legislative power requires a quorum to be present.
The two plaintiffs present before the Court, represented by and through their attorney,
do not represent a simple majority, or greater, of the City of Hattiesburg and cannot
possibly convince a court that they have interest in a power that in their capacity, they
cannot possibly exercise.

policing another branch
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"we decline – as have so many other
courts before us – to assume for ourselves the absolute power to police the other branches of government in fulfilling their constitutional duties to produce laws and executive orders, unless there is alleged a justiciable violation of a personal right." Hooker




** "The controlling issue is whether the judicial branch of government
has constitutional authority to void a facially-valid pardon issued by the coequal executive
branch, where the only challenge is compliance with Section 124's publication
requirement." **

Abstracting the controlling issue in Hooker, it is clearly the Supreme Court's position that
a facially valid executive act performed by the proper executive office is beyond the ability of the courts ability to review.





**rewrite** The court cannot be used as a tool to provide a minority a vehicle to acheive an interest that exceeds their capacity as legislators, when a majority interest is required, for otherwise, 




Timeliness.

Unusual circumstances take precendence over applications to the court that would,
under normal circumstances, be considered untimely.


A writ of mandamus will not be issued whenever public interest will be adversely affected, especially where only public political rights of those for whom petition is filed are asserted.  Wood v. State, 169 Miss. 790, 142 So 747

Writ of mandamus lies only to require performance of official duty which officer has refused to discharge.   Anderson v. Robins, 161 Miss. 604, 137 So 476

Demand for performance of act cannot be made before time has expired wherein officer is allowed to do the act.  Wood v. State, 169 Miss. 790, 142 So 747


Mandamus properly dismissed on question becoming moot.  State ex rel. Horton v. Lawrence, 121 Miss. 338, 83 So 532



 It is well-settled that “[t]he writ of mandamus is a discretionary writ and even in a case where an absolute legal right is shown, the writ will be withheld whenever the public interest would be adversely affected.”  
Bennett v. Board of Supervisors of Pearl River County, 987 So.2d 984, 987 (Miss. 2008), citing Bd. of Supervisors v. Miss. State Highway Comm'n, 207 Miss. 839, 42 So.2d 802, 805 (1949). 



COMES NOW, "intervenor's name", by and through counsel, pursuant to Rule 24 of the Mississippi Rules of Civil Procedure and moves this Court for an Order Granting Leave for Movant to Intervene in the above-styled and numbered cause, thereby allowing "intervenor's name", to file a Complaint for Intervention, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit “A”.  In support of this Motion, "intervenor's name" would show that she claims an interest in the subject matter of the pending litigation and is so situated that disposition of the above-styled and numbered cause may, as a practical matter, impair or impede "intervenor's name"’s ability to protect her interest as the existing parties do not adequately represent the interest of "intervenor's name".

Oddly enough, people remain convinced that they can administer their own computers without a coherent understanding of all the operations and codes involved, especially with respect to access rules, permissions, and delegation of authority to subordinate handlers. No person should be convinced that they can own a computer and administer to said computer without professional help.

The presence of antivirus software on a computer, coupled with evidence that such software is beneficial and useful, is a very good indicator that the person who owns the computer is very seriously in need of good, professional help.

The real problem here, is where our society does a great job of placing warning signs deterring those who may seek to practice law or medicine, as unqualified practitioners, just about every Tom, Dick, and Harry has been convinced by others that computer operating systems are easy to maintain and minister. It’s very possible that learning the law is far easier.

§ 25-1-7. Vacancy in office 


   If any person elected or appointed to any state, state district, levee board, county, county district, or municipal office shall fail to qualify as required by law on or before the day of the commencement of his term of office, or for any cause any such officer shall hold over after his regular term of office expires under the authority given him to hold over until his successor is appointed or elected and qualified, a vacancy in such office shall occur thereby and it shall be filled in the manner prescribed by law, as provided by Section 103 of the Constitution for filling vacancies in such offices, unless the failure to qualify arises from there being no officer to approve the bond of such officer-elect, and except the Governor-elect when the Legislature fixes by resolution the time of his installation. This section shall not be applicable to any coroner who fails to qualify as provided in Section 19-21-105.




At any and all meetings of the council, a majority of the members thereof shall constitute a quorum and the affirmative vote of a majority of the quorum at any meeting shall be necessary to adopt any motion, resolution or ordinance, or to pass any measure whatever unless otherwise provided in this chapter.



############################################

General law provides that “if any person […] appointed to any […] municipal office shall fail to qualify as required by law on or before the day of the commencement of his term of office, or […] hold over after his regular term of office expires, […] a vacancy in such office shall occur thereby and it shall be filled in the manner prescribed by law.”1  For department directors, the terms of those offices are coincident to the term of the mayor2; however, for other offices, the terms are able to be established by the council3, consistent with statutes, or are otherwise, by default, four years.

############################################


With regard to the provisions of § 21-8-23 Miss. Code Ann. 1972, the Mayor's duty is implied by statute, and not explicitly expressed.  The statutes concerning appointment in Chapter 8 of Title 21, Miss. Code Ann. 1972 explicitly and expressly describe appointment and confirmation.  By virtue of the Mayor exercising the executive power of the city,1 coupled with his duty to be “active and vigilant in enforcing all laws and ordinances for the government of the municipality,”2 assures us that our Legislature has not been silent concerning the duty of the Mayor to appoint many officers in the municipality.

############################################

With regard to officers where the power to appoint is vested in the “governing authorities”1 of a municipality,  our courts have determined that, with regard to a municipality under a mayor council form of government, there is an implicit presumption that appointment power is vested in the mayor, with “advice and consent” of the council being necessary to confirm the appointment.2  For the purpose of examining the applicability of a Writ of Mandamus compelling the mayor to appoint people to these particular offices where appointment power is vested in the “governing authorities” of a municipality, it is very important to partition these officers between mandatory and permissive.  For some offices, the “governing authorities” must appoint a person, while they are given permissive authority to establish offices and appoint persons to those offices.

############################################

The foregoing distinction is crucial to make when examining the Mayor's duty to appoint certain officers.  When the Court is ordering the Mayor to appoint any qualified person to an office, care should be taken to determine that such office has actually been established by the Council.  Without clear and convincing evidence that the Mayor is required by an act of municipal law to make an appointment to a permissive office, the Court may erroneously order the Mayor to appoint a person to an office that has not been established, violating city policy.1

3:25 p.m.: Robert Gholson, attorney for Hattiesburg Councilmen Kim Bradley and Carter Carroll, is starting his closing arguments. He says Mayor Johnny DuPree knew in early 2014 that Police Chief Frazier Bolton would not be approved, and delayed doing anything until the councilmen sued him. He added that the mayor is supposed to nominate, then council approves, so the mayor thwarted the process.

3:20 p.m.: Ottowa Carter Jr. is making closing arguments in today's Hattiesburg Mayor Johnny DuPree civil contempt hearing. Carter is asking that Judge Breland Hilburn look at DuPree's whole record. Carter says the mayor was trying to run the city while finding candidates. Carter asked that DuPree not be held in contempt, citing that he has done his due diligence.

2:45 p.m.: Hattiesburg Mayor Johnny DuPree testifies that his actions were in a reasonable period, given circumstances, which include nominees being rejected. DuPree added that there are always differences (between a mayor and council), but he doesn't take council to court over differences.

2:25 p.m.: Hattiesburg Mayor Johnny DuPree defends the pace at which his nominees have been brought forward. He says he has been diligent and will continue to be so.

2:15 p.m.: Hattiesburg Mayor Johnny DuPree told the court he also was considering Assistant Police Chief Frank Misenhelter and Maj. Hardy Sims for promotion within HPD. Both said no thanks. He added that he has interviewed nine candidates or so for chief so far.

2:10 p.m.: Hattiesburg Mayor Johnny DuPree's testimony on his appointees and nominations is now into the last month and the third police chief nominee. DuPree says all three would have made top shelf police chiefs, yet council blocked him. He said command staff at HPD supported Ronald Sampson Sr.

2 p.m.: Hattiesburg Mayor Johnny DuPree said Judge Breland Hilburn had previously said City Council could not substitute its judgment for the mayor's judgment.

1:45 p.m.: Hattiesburg Mayor Johnny DuPree said between 50 to 60 applications for clerk and engineer. He said he didn't bring folks forward because they didn't want to be subject of ridicule. Appointee and nominations timeline review is up to January, when Mitchell Dent was brought up for nomination as chief of police. DuPree says Dent is highly qualified "and a Hattiesburg person to boot." Dent was never brought up for consideration.

1:35 p.m.: Ottowa Carter Jr., who is Hattiesburg Mayor Johnny DuPree's attorney, is taking him through timeline of appointees and nominations for all 17 positions. Five nominees were approved as of March 2014. Lamar Rutland was approved as engineer in July 2014.


1:25 p.m.: Hattiesburg Mayor Johnny DuPree has taken the stand. DuPree testified that Police Chief Frazier Bolton would not be brought up for consideration to continue in his role.

1:15 p.m.: Hattiesburg Assistant Police Chief Frank Misenhelter says he did not write a letter submitted Monday asking that Frazier Bolton be reconsidered for chief. He said Bolton handed him the letter and asked him to sign it. Misenhelter said he has supported Bolton in the past eight years, but didn't feel his role was to pick the next chief.

1:10 p.m.: Hattiesburg Assistant Police Chief Frank Misenhelter is currently on the witness stand. Misenhelter testified that Councilwoman Deborah Delgado had said if he was nominated for chief, Hattiesburg would become another Ferguson. He then asked that his name be removed from consideration.

12:15 p.m.: Court is adjourned until 1 p.m.

12:10 p.m.: Former Hattiesburg city clerk Eddie Myers was called to the witness stand. Mayor Johnny DuPree's attorney Charles Lawrence, who also was the city's attorney, is questioning his former colleague. Lawrence brings up that in 1989, neither police chief nor fire chief were appointed, and that was during the term of Mayor Ed Morgan. Judge Breland Hilburn tells Lawrence that can go into record, but Lawrence needs to stick to the issue at hand.

Noon: Hattiesburg City Councilman Kim Bradley tells the court that council has supported and approved 16 of the 17 nominees Mayor Johnny DuPree presented. However, Bradley said, the mayor was playing games with the police chief appointees. DuPree's attorney Ottowa Carter Jr. said that wasn't what he asked. Bradley said that was his answer.

11:45 a.m.: Attorney Robert Gholson is now questioning Councilman Kim Bradley, after Mayor Johnny DuPree's attorney, Ottowa Carter Jr., chastises Bradley, who is council president, for looking beyond his Ward 1 boundaries. Carter said the mayor was elected to run the city. Carter had questioned Bradley on all of the nominees submitted by DuPree, including Frazier Bolton, who had stepped down as chief. Mitchell Dent's nomination was not brought up for consideration by any council member. Two other nominees were voted down by the council.

11:30 a.m.: Ottowa Carter Jr., an attorney for Mayor Johnny DuPree, questions Councilman Kim Bradley, but says Bradley and City Council are not letting the mayor run the city. The attorney goes back to 2012 to show what he calls pattern of refusal. Judge Breland Hilburn tells the attorney to focus only on the police chief nomination.

11 a.m.: Hattiesburg City Councilmen Kim Bradley and Carter Carroll are asking Judge L. Breland Hilburn to fine Mayor Johnny DuPree $100 a day until a police chief nominee is presented to City Council.

The two councilmen had filed suit against the mayor to force him to submit nominees for the city's appointed offices. To date, all of the offices are filled except for that of police chief.

Hilburn at an earlier hearing in the suit found DuPree in civil contempt. Today's hearing addresses the contempt issue.

Attorney Robert Gholson, who is representing Bradley and Carroll, laid out the case against Mayor DuPree, from the complainants' side.
